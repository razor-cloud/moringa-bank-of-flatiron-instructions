# Bank of Flatiron

Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data!


## Instructions

For this project, you’ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

This Phase 2 challenge will cover your knowledge of React. 
Topics will include:
- props 
- events
- rendering 
- state
- working with forms
- code structure/efficiency. 

*Please note that this does not limit you to only applying the React concepts you've learnt so far, it also calls on you to always look back to your JavaScript. These include stuff like data fetching which we learnt in phase 1*

N/B: For those who feel like they can use `useEffect()` hook, feel free to do so, but it is not a requirement for this code challenge, as we are yet to cover it.

## Endpoints

**The data to be used is in the `db.json` file inside this repo. Copy this data and paste in into your own `db.json` file in the root of your project.**

If using `Create React App`, ensure you run the JSON Server first before running the React Server. This is because both run on port 3000 by default but React's local server can find another server to run on if port 3000 is already taken by JSON Server.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

NB: **Deploy both your frontend and the `db.json` once you are done and ensure to change the URL you're fetching from to the deployed backend. Undeployed work will not be graded.**

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table and delete it from the backend.

### Endpoints for Advanced Deliverables

#### DELETE /transactions/:id

Example Response:

```json
{}
```
